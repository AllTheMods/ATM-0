## Release 0.1.0

Initial beta release of ATM-0 Not-April Edition.
Originally released as an April Fool's joke, we're bringing it back for another go.
This build focuses mainly on Reika's mods, including ChromatiCraft, RotaryCraft, ElectriCraft, and ReactorCraft.
Many familiar mods like Thermal, IC2, Thaumcraft 4, Forestry, Railcraft, and lots of others to enhance the experience.
Please report any issues on the repository here: https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-0/issues or in our Discord.

### Known Issues
- In windowed mode, the world will start with a fully black screen. Press F11 twice to get rid of it.
- ChromatiCraft cave crystal rendering is bugged due to interactions with FalseTweaks.
- Minecraft 1.7.10 does not have multi-threaded worldgen, so it will lag during exploration due to cascading worldgen.
  - You may want to pregen the world for server use, with the following commands:
    - Only run pregen when no players are online: `/pregen utils setPlayerLimit 1`
    - Generate 200 chunk radius from 0,0 in the Overworld: `/pregen gen startradius square 0 0 200`
    - Generate 100 chunk radius from 0,0 in the Nether: `/pregen gen startradius square 0 0 100 -1`
- Questlines are very minimal at the moment.
