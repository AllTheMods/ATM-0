# Release 0.1.2

If you're new to the pack, be sure to check out the introduction in the 0.1.0 changelog!

### Other Changes
- Prevent AE2 crystal seeds from floating
- Disable NEI scrollwheel handling to prevent double scrolling
- Disable Railcraft residual heat block

### Known Issues
- ChromatiCraft cave crystal rendering is bugged due to interactions with FalseTweaks.
- Minecraft 1.7.10 does not have multi-threaded worldgen, so it will lag during exploration due to cascading worldgen.
    - You may want to pregen the world for server use, with the following commands:
        - Only run pregen when no players are online: `/pregen utils setPlayerLimit 1`
        - Generate 200 chunk radius from 0,0 in the Overworld: `/pregen gen startradius square 0 0 200`
        - Generate 100 chunk radius from 0,0 in the Nether: `/pregen gen startradius square 0 0 100 -1`
- Questlines are very minimal at the moment.
